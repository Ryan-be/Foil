This software is written for the PITS Zero with Pi Zero or the PITS with Pi A+.
It works with the standard PITS software created by David Akerman 

There are several perameters which need to be edited by the user:

- The first instance of t_min and t_max - the proceding numbers should be in minuets.
- the corrdinates - the defalt code asumes a launch in tewksburry 
	- The cut down activates whenever the balloon crosses the black lines in
	  the attatched map "CutDown_map.jpg"
